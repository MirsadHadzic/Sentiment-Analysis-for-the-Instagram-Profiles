This is the project I did for ML course on Masters from Data Science. I am using Python along with its libraries to finish this. I am extracting from one .csv file a lot of data, I am filtering those data, extracting it, doing the statistics...I also used the SVM and LM along with MultinaiveBayes and Vader to do a lot of stuff. Enjoy in my work. All the best!!! <3
